# Beercan or Bacon
Learning to use the fast.ai toolchain, I proposed this excersise to myself to practice both sourcing data from api calls to image search providers and to practice using the fast.ai tools.

This is an attempt to make a classifier which can detect if an image is of a beercan, bacon or neither. The classifier is a simple homage to the awkward time of the internet between web1.0 and web2.0, where a single serving humour website brought to the attention that beercan and bacon sound identical in Jamaican accents.
